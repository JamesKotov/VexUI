The only problem is that there is no \"wysiwyg\" editor. This project tries to achieve just that!\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nPlease, please! You are more than welcome to contribute. It's been such a long time since I've been able to work on this project. Maybe you can help it get better? <br />\r\nThere is so much to do. For example:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Toolbar needs buttons for bars and clefs. For now, the only way to change to clefs and bars is by using mouse middle button;</li>\r\n\t<li>Toolbar needs an area to set key and time signatures, and RPM;</li>\r\n\t<li>Implement ties;</li>\r\n\t<li>Implement mute notes;</li>\r\n\t<li>Add support for text;</li>\r\n\t<li>Much, much more!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n## MIT License\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
